# iOS-Draw-Circles-
The user can draw multiple circles in different colors. The app will have three modes of operation: drawing, deleting and moving.The three modes are described below,
Drawing Mode: When the user places one finger on the screen a circle is drawn on the screen, the user moves their finger to increase the radius of the circle.When the user lifts their finger the size of the circle is fixed.The user can put multiple circles on the screen by touching it multiple times.While in drawing mode the user can select via a menu which color the circle should be when drawn.
Delete Mode: The user can delete circles by placing finger inside circle. If the spot where the user touches the screen is inside multiple circles at the same time they are all deleted.
Move Mode: The user sets a circle in motion by placing a finger in a circle and swiping in any direction.The circles will start moving in direction and velocity indicated by the swipe. Different circles can be moving in different directions with dif- ferent speeds. When a circle reaches the edge of the screen it will bounce off the edge properly. 
The app can only be in one mode at a time. So in the drawing mode circles are not moving.
